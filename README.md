# Plot-EPR-spectra
Automates the plotting of EPR spectra, including normalisation and subtracting background spectrum. In this branch I want to add the optionality to subtract a background spectrum for very low S/N situations where the cavity background influences the baseline and thus makes the integration boubtful.
