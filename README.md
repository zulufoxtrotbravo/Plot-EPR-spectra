# Plot-EPR-spectra
Automates the plotting of EPR spectra, including normalisation and subtracting background spectrum. 

Version 3 plots any raw data read from a folder as 1st derivative, 1st and 2nd integrals. It also reads the maximum values of the 2nd integrals and plots those vs. the file number. Field values of the max 2nd integral are also saved for quick inspection
